	<h5> Summary: </h5>
	<p> In this reading my goal is to provide you with an informative case study of an online marketing company called "Altitude Online". 
		We will be focusing on issues concerning information systems and ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning), 
		I will present the best course of action in each case in my professional opinion. </p>
	<a href = "#casestudyB">Altitude Online Case Part B</a> <a name = "PartA"> </a>
	<h3> Altitude Online Case Part A: Outgrowing Systems - Discuss the following: </h3> 
	
		
		<h4> 1.Why is it a problem for Altitude Online to use different information systems in it's branch locations? </h4>
		<p> <blockquote> They need an information system that has an<em> <b> <i>enterprise sphere of influence</i> </b> </em>
			which means that the company should unite the different branches and they should centralize their information to increase efficiency, 
			so the CIO can insure every system is being optimised, this will increase the ability for different branches to communicate which is currently 
			not possible due to the diversity of the information systems and their vendors in each different branch, 
			thus information cannot be shared smoothly and that is an important aspect for a company in the technology sector such as Altitude online, 
			also speed is essential to get an edge over competitors. </blockquote> </p>
	
	</article>
		
		<h4> 2.What information should Jon collect from the branch offices to plan the new centralized information system? </h4>
		<p> <blockquote> The type of information system needs each branch requires, he should also discuss ways to optimise the benefit while maintaining the smallest expense of 
			overhead and initial cost of the information system.  He should address the problems that each branch needs to be solved so that he can implement information system 
			that can solve the needs of each branch. In addition, he should collect backup data from each branch so that nothing is lost when new information systems are in place. 
			Jon should also collect proper networking needs of each company because without it communication data might overlap, and some data can get lost, 
			so he should relay that information to the managers to see what networking capabilities might fit them and the enterprise the best and implement it. </blockquote>
	
		<h4> 3. With Jon's education and experience, he could design and implement a new information system Altitude Online himself. 
			What would be the benefits and drawbacks of doing the job himself compared to contracting with an information systems contractor? </h4>
		
		<h5> Advantages & Disadvantages Table </h5> 
		
		<table>
			<tr> <th> Advantages </th> <th> Disadvantages </th> </tr>
		<tr> 
			<td> 
				<ol>
					<li> Creating his own <b>proprietary</b> information system can help him customise it to <br> meet the needs of the company, since he has first hand experience in what the company <br> 
						 needs this will not only upgrade the current information system, but it will also provide a <br> competitive edge over other similar information systems. <br>  <br>  </li> 
					<li> Since he designed the information system he would be able to locate and fix bugs that <br> might occur and he can personally map out upgrades for the information system to <br> meet the upcoming demands of the company since he is the one who designed the <br> information system. </li>
				</ol>
			</td>
			<td> 
				<ol>
					<li> A disadvantage would be that he would need to allocate resources and his own time as a CIO <br> as well as the time of his team which would hinder the ability of the enterprise to function 
						<br> since it lacks the management required to run and maintain their current information systems. <br>  <br>  </li> 
					<li> Another disadvantage is that new information system don’t run smoothly which means bugs <br> might arise and that will halt the functions of the business which damages the 
						image <br> of the company since information system companies are only licensing the system for our use <br> 
						we will be less likely to run into any bugs since these products have already been tested <br> and other companies are using them. </li>
				</ol>
			</td>
		</tr>
		</table>
	
		<h4> 4. While Jon is visiting the branch offices, how might he prepare them for the inevitable upheaval caused by the upcoming overhaul to the information system? </h4>
		<p> <blockquote> He should lay out a plan so that the managers and the employees to adapt to the new information system so they can easily use it and to demonstrate 
			that change is not going to take away their jobs or make their jobs harder rather increase their efficiency and decrease the workload to give them incentive to move 
			on to the new information system, otherwise if they show resistance to the change it will be harder for the company to smoothly move on to the new information system. 
			Also, Jon should create a backup of the data in the current information system so that they would be able to retrieve the data and be able to function as soon as 
			the new information system is installed so that the consumers could resume work as soon as the system is installed. To maintain the information system 
			Jon could also implement a backup plan where he would temporarily rely on cloud services so that the enterprise wouldn’t have to stop its functioning. </blockquote> </p>

		<h3> Altitude Online Case Part B: Addressing the Needs of the Organization - Discuss the following: </h3>
		
		<h4> 1. What are the advantages of Altitude Online adopting a new ERP system compared to simply connecting existing corporate systems? </h4>
		<p> <blockquote> If implemented correctly a new ERP system might give the enterprise a competitive advantage in that it might increase their efficiency and 
			lower their overhead cost of maintaining their current local systems. A new ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system will increase personal, 
			workgroup and enterprise productivity since it allows for better communication between members of the company regardless of their geographical location, 
			and it also provides personal productivity software which is software that enhances the workers ability of performing their tasks, also resource management software. 
			for instance, as payroll system that will create more time for the financial firm to deal with other pressing issues. </blockquote> </p>
		
		<h4> 2. Why isn’t an out-of-the-box ERP system enough for Altitude Online? What additional needs does the company have? Is this the case for businesses in other industries also? </h4>
		<p> <blockquote> An out of the box technology won’t give Altitude Online which is an online marketing enterprise the edge they need in their field. 
			As competition exists in every industry a technology based company should have unique and cutting-edge technology that would keep them ahead of other 
			enterprises that offer lower prices or offer a better product otherwise the company itself will not grow or even decline upon increase of competition in the market. 
			Also a company should always provide room for expansion into other media platforms of online advertisment so a unique ERP might provide efficient ways of delivering 
			a better interface for the customer and thus increasing the market capacity of the company. Some additional needs that an online company has is it’s consumer <b> 
				interface software, enterprise wide communication network,</b> and <b>consumer needs analyzation software </b>and many other software that should provide a 
				competitive edge for the company over other online marketing enterprises. </blockquote> </p>
		
		<h4> 3. Why do you think Jon is taking weeks to directly communicate with stakeholders about the new system? </h4>
		<p> <blockquote> Since Jon lacks the technical means of communicating with his 12 other branch offices that are in different geographical locations, 
			he must travel to each location to discuss the issues. In this age of technology Jon could have avoided the travel expenses of traveling with his assistant 
			to all the locations across, like when he traveled to Chicago from New-York. This could have been avoided with a <b>Workgroup application</b> that should be 
			integrated into the enterprise such as “Skype” which allows confesses to be held with everyone involved regardless of their location, thus allowing everyone to 
			share input and that will make for a more efficient use of resources. </blockquote> </p>
		
		<h4> 4. Why do you think Jon and the system administrators decided to outsource the software for this system to an ERP company rather than developing it from scratch themselves? </h4>
		<p> <blockquote> Altitude Online chose the an approach similar to <b>Software as a Service (SaaS)</b> where they get a third party software to perform different tasks, 
			but instead of having the software run by a third party adminstration an ERP can be integrated into Altitude Online route which is as the name suggests a service where 
			a company such as Altitude Online can use an outsourced software by only paying a monthly fee or a pay per use fee. Rather than allocating resources such as time and 
			money to the development of a software it might be cheaper for Jon’s company to outsource their management software and other enterprise software from a third-party 
			company, this can also allow for the program’s maintainece to be provided by the same vendors rather than having to hire people to do that for them. There are many 
			advantages for both outsourcing and developing one’s own software but for a relatively new company that needs the software to function sooner than later they opted 
			to use outsourcing method since it fit their limited needs. Maybe down the line when the need for a new ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) when the company expands 
			and acquires more assets than can be allocated to this new Enterprise software maybe then having proprietary software might prove to be. </blockquote> </p>
