# HTML-Project-Enterprise-Resource-Planning

In this project my goal was to provide you with an informative case study of an online marketing company called "Altitude Online". We will be focusing on issues concerning information systems and ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning), I will present the best course of action in each case in my opinion.

I was given a case study about a company where we were given some background on how the company runs and were told how can we optimize their information systems. This was part of an ITEC course I did in 2017 my first year of school where I received an A in the course. One of the approaches I talked about was centralizing the information systems where all the company's branches rely on one central system. This course helped me understand that centralizing data can cut costs most of the time but it is not always the optimal solution, we should always study a company's specific case before reaching a conclusion about the implementation of the information systems. Because sometimes the costs of changing the design of the information systems within a company might outweigh the benifits, that is something a professional should thoroughly investigate. This project was written in  HTML4 because HTML5 was relatively new at the time and the assignment asked us to implement the questionnaire using HTML4, where I used <a> tags, and I included meta tags in the header which are HTML4 features. There is also embedded CSS for designing the background. 

I believe this project has taught me to write readable and well indented HTML files. In addition, I feel that I have a better understanding of how information processing and sharing within a company is sometimes a hidden cost that professionals can mitigate.
